=== 作者: 叶芝 ===
    When you are old and gray and full of sleep,<br />
    And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br />
    And slowly read, and dream of the soft look,<br />
    Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;<br />
    <br />
    How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br />
    And loved your beauty with love false or true,<br />
    But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br />
    And loved the sorrows of your changing face;<br />
    <br />
    And bending down beside the glowing bars,<br />
    Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled,<br />
    And paced upon the mountains overhead,<br />
    And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.<br />
